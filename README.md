# $tags
$tags - An easy way to implement HTML tags within a page while using document.getElementById("ID").innerHTML

$tags is a library of HTML tags that can be implemented in a HTML page with document.getElementById("ID").innerHTML.

Once you have downloaded the .js file, copy it to the folder containing your HTML project then reference the library in each page you need it by using <script src="name.js"></script> OR
copy the contents of the .js file to your HTML page between some script tags.

To use the HTML tags within this library, use the following format:

$tags.(HTML Tag Name).(o, c or u)

O being for an opening tag e.g. <p>

C being for a closing tag e.g. </p>

U being for an unfinished tag (one you would like to add style, classes, IDs to etc) e.g. <p 

Open the file named "VIEWME.html" if you would like to see an example of this library in use.
